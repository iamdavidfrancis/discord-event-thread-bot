# Discord Event Thread Bot

[![Publish Docker Image](https://github.com/iamdavidfrancis/discord-event-thread-bot/actions/workflows/publish-docker.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/iamdavidfrancis/discord-event-thread-bot/actions/workflows/publish-docker.yml)

Allows users to create threads for their events easily. Still very much a Proof of Concept.

**Note:** This doesn't use the "Events" feature in Discord. This simply makes threads in a channel and posts and embed with event details.

This is mostly a learning exercise because I was bored. Don't expect great things here.
